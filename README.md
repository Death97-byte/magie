# The project

This project was created by Alumnos de Henry with the idea of providing support for having your own page with the WordPress and WooCommerce backend.

## Project scope

The project is designed more than anything for mid-level E-commerce. We use new technologies like React - Redux - Material UI.

All the parameters of the page, such as products, names, categories. They are taken from your WordPress anyway, 
it is possible to change it but it will require extra knowledge.


### `Do you want to try it?`

You will have to change the parameters of the WordPress API in the Config.jsx file.
- URL
- consumeKey
- consumerSecreyKey
- version

Then run start in stash console
